we are using html, css and javascript for coding. this website was inspired by netflix do we made own netflix version.

the html is the details of the website that only text and pictures, by using css it gives the html lively that can design the website. also we are used the java script to more lively, java script gives a website an animation.

in index.html, we are only give a log in page just like a netflix log in page. in this page we're used css only so the're is no animation in this page. index is a default opening page so the browser will find or read the index html or php (if the page is php language) then it will show in browser. there are many class in css that helps the html to make a accurate in the website. the home, div, table etc are can change the shape or color by using the css.

in profile.html we're used java script and we attached a modal. in this webpage the modal is the pop up animation that give the details of a student so every click the picture if a student the modal will uppear. there is an id in the picture that connected in modal.
